    <h1>Hello, <h2>I am Harshit Malviya </h2>
        <h2> I am a boy</h2>
         <h3>I am a Dancer</h3>
        </h1>
    <!-- This is a paragraph -->
    <p>Everyone has an ideal person. One follows one’s ideal according to the best of one’s abilities.<br> 
        Since I am a student, my ideal is my friend Rohit. <br>
         He is a treasure of good qualities. He keeps himself away from the company of bad boys</p>
         <p>Rohit is really a model for all of us. I also want to become like Rohit.<br> He is healthy and intelligent. All of us should try to live up to our ideals.<br>
             An ideal shows us the way. Following Rohit in these qualities, one day I hope to be even a better student like he is.<br>
             <p> This I can achieve by constant effort and hardwork. All of us must develop our ideals and follow them. </p>
